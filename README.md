# Detection-of-apple-leaf-diseases

This project aims to detect diseases in apple leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. Additionally, a user-friendly interface is created using Streamlit to facilitate easy interaction with the model.

## Requirements
tensorflow>=2.0.0
fastapi
uvicorn
python-multipart
pillow
tensorflow>=2.0.0
matplotlib
numpy
## The Dataset  
The PlantVillage dataset consists of high-quality images of various plant diseases, including annotated labels for different classes. More information about the dataset can be found on the [PlantVillage website](https://plantvillage.psu.edu/).


## Deployment

The application is deployed and accessible online. You can interact with the Plant Disease Detection app by visiting the following link:
